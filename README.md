# Default-Prediction-and-Stock-Market-Risk-Analysis
**Finance and Risk Analytics**

**Completion Date:** June 2024

This project is a comprehensive exploration of financial risk analysis, divided into two major parts: **Default Prediction and Financial Health Analysis (Part A)** and **Market Risk Analysis (Part B)**. It aims to equip investors, financial institutions, and businesses with the necessary tools and insights for informed decision-making in the realms of credit risk and market volatility.

**Part A: Default Prediction and Financial Health Analysis**

**Context:**  
In today's financial landscape, companies must manage their debt obligations effectively to maintain a favorable credit standing and support sustainable growth. Investors are particularly interested in evaluating the financial health of businesses to ensure stability and profitability. This evaluation often relies on analyzing a company's balance sheet, which provides a detailed overview of its assets, liabilities, and equity.

**Objective:**  
The project focuses on developing a **Financial Health Assessment Tool** using machine learning techniques. This tool is designed to assist businesses and investors by evaluating a company's financial well-being and creditworthiness. The tool analyzes historical financial data to achieve the following:

1. **Debt Management Analysis:** Identifies patterns in debt management to assess a company's ability to meet its financial obligations and detect potential default risks.
2. **Credit Risk Evaluation:** Evaluates key financial indicators, such as liquidity ratios and debt-to-equity ratios, to estimate the likelihood of a company defaulting on its debts.

**Methodology:**  
Using the provided dataset, which includes various financial metrics from company balance sheets, the project involves developing a predictive model. This model aims to predict whether a company will be categorized as a defaulter based on its projected net worth for the following year. The insights gained from this model can help venture capitalists and other stakeholders anticipate financial challenges and implement proactive risk mitigation strategies.

**Key Financial Metrics Analyzed:**
- Net Worth, Total Assets, Total Income, Total Expenses, Profit After Tax, Debt-to-Equity Ratio, etc.

**Part B: Market Risk Analysis**

**Context:**  
Market risk, driven by fluctuations in asset prices due to economic events, geopolitical developments, and changing investor sentiments, is a critical factor for investors. Understanding and analyzing this risk is essential for making informed investment decisions and optimizing portfolio strategies.

**Objective:**  
The objective of this part is to conduct a **Market Risk Analysis** on a portfolio of Indian stocks using historical stock price data. The analysis seeks to provide investors with insights into market volatility and the risk associated with individual stocks and the overall portfolio.

**Goals of the Analysis:**
1. **Risk Assessment:** Evaluate the historical volatility of individual stocks and the overall portfolio to understand market risk.
2. **Portfolio Optimization:** Use the insights from the analysis to enhance risk-adjusted returns.
3. **Performance Evaluation:** Assess the effectiveness of portfolio management strategies in mitigating market risk.
4. **Portfolio Performance Monitoring:** Continuously monitor and adjust portfolio performance based on changing market conditions.

**Methodology:**  
The analysis uses statistical measures, such as the mean and standard deviation of stock returns, to evaluate the riskiness of the portfolio. By examining weekly stock price data for five Indian stocks over an eight-year period, the project provides a detailed understanding of stock performance and portfolio variability.

**Key Metrics Analyzed:**
- Historical Stock Prices, Volatility (Standard Deviation), Mean Returns, etc.
